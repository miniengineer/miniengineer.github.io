## Who I am
I am a mom and a beginner Linux user who wants to improve her technical skills to gain more confidence and be better at my job as SRE engineering manager.
This blog is created to document my journey and to keep me motivated.
Most of the days I don't have much time since I work 9-5, so having some sort of accountability and a paper trail should help my sanity :)
