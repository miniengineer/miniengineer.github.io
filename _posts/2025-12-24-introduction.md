# Introduction

This blog exists so I can document my learnings and keep myself accountable.
There are four big categories that I am focused on:

- Passing the Certified Kubernetes Administrator Exam
- Getting hands-on experience with AWS
- Reading the Systems Design Interview book to get better at making trade-offs
- Leetcode-style challenges to keep my problem solving skills sharp

I am working-full time so in general I have only 2-3 hours a day to study.
On weekends I can only read the Systems Design book because we usualy go out as a family.

I am curious for how long I will stay engaged and how this will affect my career.

If there is anyone else who wants to brush up on their technical skills, they could potentially use this as a guide or curriculum.

Let's do this!
